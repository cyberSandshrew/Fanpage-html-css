        <p>This POKéMON curls up to protect itself from its enemies. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>SANDSHREW's body is configured to absorb water without waste, 
        enabling it to survive in an arid desert. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>SANDSHREW has a very dry hide that is extremely tough. 
        The POKéMON can roll into a ball that repels any attack.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep. </p>
